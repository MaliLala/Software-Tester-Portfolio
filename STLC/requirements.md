1. Product Rating System
   
Requirement:
Users must be able to rate products using a 5-star rating system.

Users must have the option to add written feedback along with their rating.

The system must allow users to update or delete their ratings.

Only registered users can leave ratings and reviews.

Ratings and reviews must be displayed on the product page, sorted by date or helpfulness.

Reviews must be moderated to filter out inappropriate content (e.g., offensive language, spam).



3. Age Verification for Alcoholic Products
   
Requirement:
When a user navigates to the Alcoholic Products category, a modal popup must appear asking for age verification.

Users must enter their date of birth to proceed.

If the user is under 18, they must be redirected away from the alcoholic products section.

If the user is 18 or older, they gain access to the section.

The system should remember verified users for the session but must require verification again on a new session.


5. Shipping Cost Changes
   
Requirement:
Orders over $50 (example amount, configurable by admin) qualify for free shipping.

Orders below this threshold will incur a shipping fee based on weight and destination.

The shipping fee must be clearly displayed at checkout before final payment.

Discounts applied after adding items to the cart should not affect free shipping eligibility.

The system must handle varied shipping costs for different regions, with a proper cost calculation system in place.
