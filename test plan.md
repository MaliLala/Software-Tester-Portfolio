## 4. Test Strategy

### Scope of Testing

**In Scope:**
- Functional testing for new features.
- UI/UX testing to ensure usability.
- Security testing (limited to authentication and data integrity, not deep penetration testing).
- Performance testing (load testing with simulated traffic, stress testing thresholds).
- Usability testing.
- Testing of extremely rare edge cases and worst-case scenarios.

**Out of Scope:**
- Deep backend security penetration testing.

### Type of Testing
- Functional Testing
- UI Testing
- Security Testing (focused on authentication and data security)
- Regression Testing
- Usability Testing
- Performance Testing (simulating expected user load and worst-case failure conditions)
- Edge Case Testing (handling unexpected user behaviors and extreme edge cases)

### Risks and Issues
- **Delays in development** → Plan buffer time.
- **Lack of test data** → Create mock data sets.
- **Resource unavailability** → Identify backup resources.
- **Unforeseen edge cases** → Ensure adaptability in test planning.

## 5. Test Objectives

### Goals
- **Functionality**: Ensure new features work correctly under normal and extreme conditions.
- **GUI**: Ensure UI is intuitive, responsive, and functional even under adverse conditions.
- **Performance**: Verify the site runs smoothly under expected loads and stress conditions.
- **Security**: Ensure authentication and data integrity are robust and resistant to extreme exploits.
- **Usability**: Ensure ease of use for all users, including those facing unusual scenarios.

### Expected Results
- **Functionality**: No unexpected errors, even in extreme cases.
- **GUI**: Responsive and free of major UI defects across all test scenarios.
- **Performance**: Handles expected traffic without major slowdowns, recovers from stress failures.
- **Security**: No easy workarounds for age verification, authentication bypass, or critical vulnerabilities.
- **Usability**: Users can navigate and complete tasks easily, even in worst-case scenarios.

## 6. Test Criteria

### Suspension Criteria
- Testing will be suspended if critical defects block further testing.
- Unavailability of required resources or test environment failures.
- Discovery of high-risk security or performance vulnerabilities requiring immediate fixes.

### Exit Criteria
- All planned tests have been executed, including worst-case scenario tests.
- At least 90% of executed test cases have passed, with no unresolved critical defects.
- No blocking or high-priority defects remain, even in extreme cases.
- User acceptance testing is completed and approved.
